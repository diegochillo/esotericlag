General instructions:
You receive a text "T", a frame-based knowledge graph "KG" that is the extraction of factual knowledge from T, and a complete ontology "ONT". 

The KG is expressed according to:
- the semantics of OWL2 logic language
- frame semantics principles as formalised in the Framester schema (https://w3id.org/framester/schema/)
- RDF language serialized in Turtle syntax

The alignments in KG are to PropBank, WordNet, VerbAtlas, Wikidata, DBpedia, DOLCE-Zero, etc. 

T: 
{{ Text }}

KG:
{{ KG }}

ONT:
{{ ONT }}

Task:
Your goal is to extend KG with more knowledge that can be assumed from T, but it is not explicit.
Using the elements of KG, PropBank and WordNet elements as linking points, and classes and properties from ONT, add any further elements you need to extract implicit knowledge about:  Carl Gustav Jung's perspective on it.

Here are some questions Jung would pose to analyze esoteric artifacts from his psychological perspective:
META-QUESTION: What is the historical and cultural context in which this artifact emerged, and what collective psychological need or crisis was it responding to?
What psychic opposites are expressed or implied by the artifact, and how does the artifact symbolize their separation and potential synthesis (coniunctio)?
What unconscious contents (archetypes or complexes) are being projected into this artifact, and what unconscious counterposition or compensatory reaction does it express relative to the prevailing conscious attitude?
How does this artifact relate to the archetype of the Self (totality), and does it express the movement toward individuation, potentially manifesting in quaternary or circular/mandala form?
What primordial images (archetypes) are contained within the artifact, and what parallels can be found in mythology, religion, dreams, or other esoteric traditions to understand its universal significance?
What is the necessary conscious attitude or psychological approach required to engage with this artifact or its contents, and what transformative effect does it ultimately demand?

Add Carl Gustav Jung's perspective triples to the KG considering the original text T and the ontology ONT.
Print the newly generated triples only.
