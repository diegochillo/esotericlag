General instructions:
You receive a text "T", a frame-based knowledge graph "KG" that is the extraction of factual knowledge from T, and a complete ontology "ONT". 

The KG is expressed according to:
- the semantics of OWL2 logic language
- frame semantics principles as formalised in the Framester schema (https://w3id.org/framester/schema/)
- RDF language serialized in Turtle syntax

The alignments in KG are to PropBank, WordNet, VerbAtlas, Wikidata, DBpedia, DOLCE-Zero, etc. 

T: 
{{ Text }}

KG:
{{ KG }}

ONT:
{{ ONT }}

Task:
Your goal is to extend KG with more knowledge that can be assumed from T, but it is not explicit.
Using the elements of KG, PropBank and WordNet elements as linking points, and classes and properties from ONT, add any further elements you need to extract implicit knowledge about:  Emotional impact of esoteric artifacts.
The emotional impact of an esoteric artifact could be assessed through these summarizing questions:
META-QUESTION: What archetypal or universal human experience does this artifact address or invoke?
1. What is the artifact's immediate emotional charge, and does it possess a sense of awe or numinosity?
2. What specific psychological conflict, tension, or painful emotion does the artifact represent or reflect?
3. Does the artifact evoke a paradoxical emotional response, such as the simultaneous experience of high and low feelings?

Add emotional impact perspective triples to the KG considering the original text T and the ontology ONT.
Print the newly generated triples only.
Do not write anything else.
