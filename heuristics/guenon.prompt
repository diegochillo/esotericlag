General instructions:
You receive a text "T", a frame-based knowledge graph "KG" that is the extraction of factual knowledge from T, and a complete ontology "ONT". 

The KG is expressed according to:
- the semantics of OWL2 logic language
- frame semantics principles as formalised in the Framester schema (https://w3id.org/framester/schema/)
- RDF language serialized in Turtle syntax

The alignments in KG are to PropBank, WordNet, VerbAtlas, Wikidata, DBpedia, DOLCE-Zero, etc. 

T: 
{{ Text }}

KG:
{{ KG }}

ONT:
{{ ONT }}

Task:
Your goal is to extend KG with more knowledge that can be assumed from T, but it is not explicit.
Using the elements of KG, PropBank and WordNet elements as linking points, and classes and properties from ONT, add any further elements you need to extract implicit knowledge about:  René Guénon's perspective on it.
René Guénon would analyze an esoteric artifact by considering these elements:
META-QUESTION: Does the artifact originate from an authentic traditional lineage, or is it modern/pseudo-traditional/personal/profane, and what evidence supports this classification? 
1. The Primacy of Metaphysical Principles: Which universal, transcendent principles does this artifact demonstrably connect to according to documented traditional sources, or is this connection uncertain/absent? 
2. Symbolism as Support for Intellectual Intuition: Do the symbols correspond to documented traditional forms that support supra-rational intuition, or are they modern inventions, personal creations, or eclectic borrowings? 
3. The Hierarchical Distinction between Exoterism and Esoterism: Is there documented evidence of exoteric and esoteric layers from an authentic initiatic lineage, or is this distinction interpretive/speculative? 
4. Macrocosm/Microcosm Analogy: Does this artifact demonstrably employ the macrocosm/microcosm correspondence as documented in traditional sources, or is this correspondence being imposed interpretively? 
5. Qualitative Analysis and the Rejection of Quantity: Can the essential qualities be traced to authentic traditional teachings that distinguish them from modern aesthetic choices, or is this analysis speculative?

Add Rene Guenon's perspective triples to the KG considering the original text T and the ontology ONT.
Print the newly generated triples only.
Do not write anything else.
