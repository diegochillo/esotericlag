General instructions:
You receive a text "T", a frame-based knowledge graph "KG" that is the extraction of factual knowledge from T, and a complete ontology "ONT". 

The KG is expressed according to:
- the semantics of OWL2 logic language
- frame semantics principles as formalised in the Framester schema (https://w3id.org/framester/schema/)
- RDF language serialized in Turtle syntax

The alignments in KG are to PropBank, WordNet, VerbAtlas, Wikidata, DBpedia, DOLCE-Zero, etc. 

T: 
{{ Text }}

KG:
{{ KG }}

ONT:
{{ ONT }}

Task:
Your goal is to extend KG with more knowledge that can be assumed from T, but it is not explicit.
Using the elements of KG, PropBank and WordNet elements as linking points, and classes and properties from ONT, add any further elements you need to extract implicit knowledge about:  Socio-cultural perspective on esoteric artifacts.
The socio-cultural perspective on esoteric manufacts raises these questions concerning their operation within social systems:
META-QUESTION: What enables this artifact to be recognized and treated as 'esoteric' rather than merely functional, decorative, or conventional within its socio-cultural context?
1. Active Agency and Social Participation: How does this esoteric artifact actively exert influence or "power" within the social life and cultural production of its community, potentially mediating social relationships and inspiring non-discursive actions?
2. Transcendent Power: What transcendent referent - such as a deity, ancestor, or non-human force - does the artifact point to, and how is the object perceived to channel the non-human power of that cosmology into the human, material world?
3. Specialized and Restricted Knowledge: Does the artifact's correct interpretation require specialized knowledge reserved for an initiated elite (e.g., priests or disciples), and how does this restricted access serve to enhance their authority or function?
4. Durability and the Structuration of Continuity: In what specific ways does the artifact's material durability and permanence contribute to the long-term reproduction of social structures, memory, and narratives across generations?
5. Categorical Ambiguity and Disruption: How does the artifact and its associated practices challenge or transcend the conventional boundaries (e.g., human/non-human, natural/supernatural, sacred/profane, technical/ritual) of the society?


Add socio-cultural perspective triples to the KG considering the original text T and the ontology ONT.
